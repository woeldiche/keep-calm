# Keep Calm and Clear Cache
A tiny web project by Jesper WÃ¸ldiche

## Ideas for further development
### Roll your own
Allow users to roll their own mottos and have them shown on keepcalm.dk using GET or fragment-identifiers.

### Reload
Ability to load new motto through ajax without reloading page.

### Shake to reload
Support for accelerometer on iPhone to reload by shaking the app. Is it even possible to access accellerometer from webapp.
